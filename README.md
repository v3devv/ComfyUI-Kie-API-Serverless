# ComfyUI KIE API Nodes (Serverless Edition)

## Project overview
A **serverless-compatible** fork of ComfyUI custom nodes that connect to the Kie.ai API for image and video generation workflows.

**Key difference from original:** API key is passed as a node input field instead of loaded from a config file, making it work in serverless environments like Modal, ComfyDeploy, and RunPod.

## Why this fork exists
The original KIE API nodes load the API key from a config file (`config/kie_key.txt`), which doesn't work in serverless/ephemeral environments. This fork exposes the API key as a mandatory input field on each node, allowing you to:
- Save the key directly in your workflow JSON
- Use it in ComfyDeploy, Modal, RunPod serverless, etc.
- Run alongside the original KIE nodes (different node IDs with `[SL]` suffix)

### Supporting Development

This project is built for the ComfyUI community and maintained in personal time.

If you find the nodes useful and are already planning to use **Kie.ai**, using the link below is one way to support continued development and improvements. There is no obligation, and everything works the same regardless.

## What’s included
- Image generation nodes
- Image-to-video and text-to-video nodes
- Utility helpers for grid slicing and prompt parsing

Node-specific documentation is available in `web/docs`.

## API Key Setup

**No file setup required!** Simply enter your Kie.ai API key directly in the `api_key` field on each node.

⚠️ **Security Note:** The API key will be saved in plain text in your workflow JSON file. Don't share workflows publicly without removing it first.

## Current Available Nodes

This node pack currently includes the following nodes:

### Generation Nodes

- **Nano Banana Pro Image**
  - Image generation node using the Googles Nano Banana Pro model

  - Text-to-image and image-editing node for Seedream models.
  - Supports prompt-based generation and edits.

- **Flux 2 Image-to-Image (Pro/Flex)**
  - Image-to-image node with a model dropdown for Pro or Flex.
  - Accepts 1–8 input images via ComfyUI batch.

- **Gemini 3 Pro (LLM) [Experimental]**
  - Text generation node using Gemini 3 Pro chat completions.
  - Supports role selection, media inputs (images/video/audio), optional reasoning output, and Google Search toggle.

- **Kling 2.6 Image-to-Video**
  - Generates video from a single input image.
  - Uses the Kling 2.6 image-to-video model.

- **Kling 2.5 I2V Pro**
  - Generates video from a required first image and optional tail image.
  - Uses the Kling 2.5 Turbo image-to-video Pro model.

- **Kling 2.6 Text-to-Video**
  - Generates video directly from a text prompt.
  - Supports aspect ratio, duration, and sound options as exposed by the API.

- **Kling 2.6 Motion-Control Image-to-Video**
  - Image-to-video generation with additional motion control parameters.
  - Designed for more directed camera and motion behavior.

- **Seedance V1 Pro (Fast) Image-to-Video**  
  Fast image-to-video generation optimized for quick iteration.

- **Seedance 1.5 Pro Image-to-Video, Text-to-Video**  
  Higher-quality image-to-video generation using the Seedance 1.5 Pro model.


### Utility / Helper Nodes

- **Get Remaining Credits**
  - Return number of credits remaining
  - Useful for verifying that your API key is working
  
- **GridSlice**
  - Splits a grid image (such as 2×2 or 3×3) into individual images for downstream processing.

- **Prompt Grid JSON Parser**
  - Parses structured JSON output (for example, from an LLM) into individual prompt outputs.
  - Designed for multi-image and storyboard-style workflows.

Each node has its own documentation page under `web/docs/` with detailed inputs, outputs, and usage examples.

## Included Example Workflows

This repository includes two example workflows intended as both a test bed and a reference for how these nodes can be used together.

---

### 1) Node Pack Test & Reference Workflow
**Kie-AI-Nodes.json**

This workflow includes **all nodes in this pack**, each accompanied by inline notes explaining what the node does and how to use it.

**Recommended first step:**  
Always start by running the **Credits / Account Check** node. This confirms:
- Your Kie.ai API key is installed correctly
- Your account has available credits
- The API is reachable

Once credits are confirmed, you can unmute individual node groups and test them incrementally. This workflow is designed to be a safe environment for validation, learning, and debugging before building custom graphs.

---

### 2) Nano Banana Pro Grid Workflow (Advanced Example)
**Kie-AI-Banana-Pro-Grid.json**

This workflow demonstrates a more advanced use case built around **Nano Banana Pro** and grid-based image generation.

**Overview:**
- An optional *face reference image* and a required *source image* are provided
- A language model analyzes the inputs and generates structured prompts
- These prompts are used to generate a **2×2 or 3×3 grid of images**
- The resulting grid is then sliced into individual images using the Grid Slice node

**About the LLM step:**
- This workflow uses an OpenAI Chat LLM node provided by ComfyUI (not part of this node pack)
- This step incurs its own API cost
- You are free to replace this LLM with any compatible model or remove it entirely

**Why this workflow exists:**
This pattern is useful for:
- Generating multiple prompt variations from a single concept
- Creating image sets for downstream video generation
- Breaking large composite images into reusable individual assets

---

Both workflows are meant as **examples**, not strict requirements.  
Feel free to adapt, simplify, or remix them to fit your own pipelines.

## About Kie.ai
Kie.ai is a unified API and model marketplace for image, video, and audio generation. This project is community-maintained and not affiliated with Kie.ai. Learn more at [https://kie.ai](https://kie.ai?ref=e7565cf24a7fad4586341a87eaf21e42).

## Credits and usage
Kie.ai uses a credit-based model for requests. There is no subscription requirement, and pay-as-you-go usage is supported.

## Debugging and job visibility
You can review request history and results at [https://kie.ai/logs](https://kie.ai/logs). Some models can take longer to finish; the default timeout has been increased to reduce false failures.

## Sponsorship / Development

This project is developed and maintained with support from **Dreaming Computers**  
[https://dreamingcomputers.com](https://dreamingcomputers.com)

Dreaming Computers is an independent studio exploring AI, creative tooling, and automation-driven workflows. The nodes in this pack are built from practical use cases and ongoing experimentation, and are shared with the community as they evolve.
